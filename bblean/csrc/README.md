# C++ extensions for accellerated similarity calculations and clustering

- `kernels.hpp`: popcounts, Tanimoto similarity, iSIM, majority centroids, the most
  dissimilar pair of a set of fingerprints and the merge criteria, shared by both
  extensions.
- `similarity.cpp`: `bblean._cpp_similarity`, used by `bblean.similarity`.
- `bitbirch.cpp`: `bblean._cpp_bitbirch`, the BitBirch tree used by `bblean.BitBirch`
  (same results as the python tree).
